# JSNN-playground
A super-minimalist neural network playground in JavaScript. I find nothing more effective than this for teaching or learning new topologies in full detail right down to the optimizer. I've provided a couple of examples here and will probably keep adding more as I learn or tinker with more topologies.

# Examples
* **[nn.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toomuchvoltage/JSNN-playground/master/nn.html)**: A 3-layer non-deep neural network (1000 iterations): https://jsfiddle.net/th7ocs30/

* **[rnn.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toomuchvoltage/JSNN-playground/master/rnn.html)**: An Elman recurrent neural-network (100 iterations): https://jsfiddle.net/8j7oht62/

if you see errors by all means, open a ticket :)
